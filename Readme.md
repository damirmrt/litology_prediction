Unlike most oil deposits in various sediments, Paleozoic oil deposits do not have established search criteria. However, Paleozoic oil in the territory of Western Siberia is of great prospecting interest, since active development is underway at various fields.  On the one hand, the lack of search criteria does not allow the use of traditional methods for exploration of deposits in Paleozoic deposits. On the other hand, we have a fairly large set of unified data of potential fields, which individually in a small degree reflect the variability of lithology in the Paleozoic. Combining these data with the help of machine learning can give a significant increase in information. This notebook shows one of the approaches to the prediction of lithotypes in the Paleozoic
